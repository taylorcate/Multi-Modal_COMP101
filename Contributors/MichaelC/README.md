# A little about me...
_I'm Ms. Brown and I graduated from Loyola University Chicago with my Master's Degree in Textual Studies and Digital Humanities. I have a good background in Git and GitHub and developed this class to help students improve their digital literacy by studying communities in viral networks while contributing to a virtual space that foregrounds attribution and is open to the public just like so many of the platforms we use everyday. Below you'll see some memes I think describe me pretty well._  

**For your README.md files, I'd like you to:    
A) Choose a meme - or several - that describes you.   
B) Tell us your Major and Year.  
C) Give us your background with Git and GitHub.    
D) Add any social media presences you'd like to share.**
